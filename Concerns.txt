- Packetize needs to take in a char* instead of a FILE*

- Packetize also should be able to edit a bool value based on whether or not the file has ended.
    - A way to do that is when it needs to pad NULLs in the packet, it should mark the file as ended.
    - Use this bool in Transmit() to determine when to exit the file packetize loop
    
- Transmit has no way of pausing at the moment
    - Transmit has a comment to keep this idea around with a semaphore
